Hello World ;-)

We are building a lightweight data quality tool. The general idea is that it will help to execute data quality checks across multiple data sources and help identify and manage data quality issues. It will come with a simple web UI. The first alpha release is expected (hopefully) some time between October and December 2022. Stay tuned!
