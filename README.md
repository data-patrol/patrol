Hello and welcome!

We are a small team of data enthusiasts building a lightweight data quality tool. The general idea is that it will help to execute data quality checks across multiple data sources and help to monitor and manage data quality. With the right use, we think it can bring data quality to the next level!

The tool will come with a simple web UI and will initially support the following data sources:
- Databricks
- SQL Server
- Oracle 
- MySQL / MariaDB
- PostgreSQL

The first release (rc1) is expected (hopefully) some time between November and December 2022. Stay tuned!
